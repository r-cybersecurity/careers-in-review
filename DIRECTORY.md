### SOC Analyst

* Author: u/Oscar_Geare
* Description: 24.7 SOC Analyst is an unforgiving job. Long hours and an intense workload, however it's the most common 'entry-level' position available in most metropolitan areas. Depending on the organisation, you may have greater or less freedom of work, able to follow through and conduct incident response yourself. In the end, the job comes back to the same thing: Investigating alerts, triaging and conducting first level analysis to escalate to responder teams.
