### Threat Intelligence

* Author: u/CrowGrandFather
* Description: Threat Intelligence is a complementary service to help guide security operations. A threat intelligence analyst can be expected to research indicators of compromise, read reporting, and provide actionable courses of action. Threat Intelligence is incredibly difficult to do well but it a great place to learn the ins and outs of SOC work without the high stakes fast paced action of SOC work. I started in threat intelligence and I'm managing an incident response team now.

### SOC Analyst

* Author: u/Oscar_Geare
* Description: 24.7 SOC Analyst is an unforgiving job. Long hours and an intense workload, however it's the most common 'entry-level' position available in most metropolitan areas. Depending on the organisation, you may have greater or less freedom of work, able to follow through and conduct incident response yourself. In the end, the job comes back to the same thing: Investigating alerts, triaging and conducting first level analysis to escalate to responder teams.

### Product Security Engineer

* Author: u/tweedge
* Description: Product Security is a role that helps companies make their software products more secure. That could be anything from securing websites, to smart IoT lights, cars, networking software, and much more. My role in Product Security relied on familiarity with coding, security expertise, and creative problem solving, as I worked to improve the security of popular products deployed around the world. This is a harder job to get started in and often relies on competitive applicants coming out of college or who have prior experience (especially in or near Software Engineering - which is what I did).
