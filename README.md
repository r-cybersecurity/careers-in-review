# how-mentors-began-in-security
This is an invite-only program for positive members of r/cybersecurity to create a shortish article detailing how they broke in to security, where they are now, and what people should know about the field. We would want those hosted on your blog, **not** CC licensed (I mean, if you really want to, I'm not stopping you?), and we will provide a link to those plus a short bio about you in an r/cybersecurity wiki page.

This is inspired by: https://lethain.com/my-career-story/ as a possible solution to our need to express that people take many winding paths into security, because a lot of people are looking for the "one true way," and there truly isn't one.

### To submit a response

* Write a short bio about yourself/your work, a minimum of 3 sentences, and no more than 5-7.
* Submit an issue containing:
  * That bio
  * A link to your blog post

The blog post should roughly fit the questionnaire, but please add or subtract content as you see fit for flow or to cover important things that newcomers should know.

### The questionnaire

About you:
* Cover something about your current/recent role(s) to establish your credibility.
* How did you get interested in cybersecurity?

About your first job:
* What was your first job in cybersecurity? When was that, and what were your responsibilities?
  * Consider quickly listing out common "topics" which people are often curious or worried about, such as: how much coding/IT/math/communication/etc. was involved.
* What were the most important technical skills that allowed you to succeed in that role?
* What were the most important attributes and personality traits that allowed you to succeed in that role?

About how you broke in:
* What degrees, certifications, bootcamps, or field experience did you have at that time?
  * If you have a tech or tech-adjacent degree: Were there other degrees you were considering at the time? Why did you choose the degree(s) you did?
  * If you have a non-tech degree: How has your degree contributed to your career in cybersecurity?
  * If you have certifications: What certifications were most impactful for advancing your knowledge or job hunt while breaking in?
  * If you have bootcamp experience: [still thinking about this one]
  * If you have prior experience: How did your field experience help you at the start of yout career in cybersecurity?
* Would you recommend the path you took to get into cybersecurity? Are there cases where you *wouldn't* recommend it?

Giving advice:
* What are the top three things you think people considering cybersecurity careers should know about the field?
* What are some projects you'd recommend for people trying to figure out if [one or more of the first roles you've held] could be right for them?

Please note: this is a work in progress and may be updated.
