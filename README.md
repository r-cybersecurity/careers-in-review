# your-experience-starting-in-security
This is an invite-only program for positive members of r/cybersecurity to create a shortish article detailing how they broke in to security, where they are now, and what people should know about the field. We would want those hosted on your blog, **not** CC licensed (I mean, if you really want to, I'm not stopping you?), and we will provide a link to those plus a short bio about you in an r/cybersecurity wiki page.

This is inspired by: https://lethain.com/my-career-story/ as a possible solution to our need to express that people take many winding paths into security, because a lot of people are looking for the "one true way," and there truly isn't one.

### To submit a response

* Write a short bio about yourself/your work, a minimum of 3 sentences, and no more than 5-7.
* Submit an issue containing:
  * That bio
  * A link to your blog post

The blog post should roughly fit the questionnaire, but please add or subtract content as you see fit for flow or to cover important things that newcomers should know.

### The questionnaire

About your first job:
* What was your first job in cybersecurity? When was that, and what were your responsibilities?
  * Be sure to explain how your role fits into the broader security field, ex. DevSecOps puts security into the software development lifecycle, which tightly integrates security and software development efforts, etc. This may not be obvious to outsiders.
* Can you discuss some specific tasks you did, or goals you contributed towards? 
* What were the most important technical skills that allowed you to succeed in that role?
* What were the most important attributes and personality traits that allowed you to succeed in that role?

About how you broke in:
* What degrees, certifications, bootcamps, or field experience did you have at that time?
  * If you have a tech or tech-adjacent degree: Were there other degrees you were considering at the time? Why did you choose the degree(s) you did?
  * If you have a non-tech degree: How has your degree contributed to your career in cybersecurity?
  * If you have certifications: What certifications were most impactful for advancing your knowledge or job hunt while breaking in?
  * If you have bootcamp experience: [still thinking about this one]
  * If you have prior experience: How did your field experience help you at the start of yout career in cybersecurity?
* Out of degrees, certifications, bootcamps, and field experience: what mattered the most for obtaining your role?
* Would you recommend the path you took to get into cybersecurity? Are there cases where you *wouldn't* recommend it?

Giving advice:
* What are the top three things you think people considering cybersecurity careers should know about the field?
* What are some projects you'd recommend for people trying to figure out if [your role] could be right for them?
* If coding was a big part of your role: What coding languages would you recommend people learn to be best-prepared for [your role]?


About the author:
* Free space. Talk about the cool stuff you do now, all the ways people can find or follow you for research articles or hot memes. Don't be afraid to toot your own horn a bit. This is a long questionnaire if completed in depth and we - maintainers and readers alike - appreciate that you've taken the time to do this.

Please note: this is a work in progress and may be updated.
