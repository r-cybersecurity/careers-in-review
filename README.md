# how-mentors-began-in-security
This is an invite-only program for positive members of r/cybersecurity to create a shortish article detailing how they broke in to security, where they are now, and what people should know about the field. We would want those hosted on your blog, **not** CC licensed (I mean, if you really want to, I'm not stopping you?), and we will provide a link to those plus a short bio about you in an r/cybersecurity wiki page.

This is inspired by: https://lethain.com/my-career-story/ as a possible solution to our need to express that people take many winding paths into security, because a lot of people are looking for the "one true way," and there truly isn't one.

### To submit a response

* Write a short bio about yourself/your work, a minimum of 3 sentences, and no more than 5-7.
* Submit an issue containing:
  * That bio
  * A link to your blog post

### The questionnaire

First, please introduce yourself - cover something about your current/recent role(s) to establish your credibility.

* How did you get interested in cybersecurity?
* What was your first job (intern or not) in cybersecurity?
  * Be sure to note when that was!
* Broadly, what did you do in your first role in security?
* What experience, degrees, or certifications did you have at that point?
* What soft or hard skills helped you break in or build your career?
* Would you recommend the path you took to get into cybersecurity? Are there cases where you *wouldn't* recommend it?

Please note: this is a work in progress and is not the final questionnaire list.
